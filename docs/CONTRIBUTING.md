# Contributing to VSD Fleet Management System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VSD Fleet Management System! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors of all types - developers, business analysts, documentation writers, and fleet management experts.

## üìù Project Background

This is a community fork of the original [VVSD-LTD/vsd_fleet_ms](https://github.com/VVSD-LTD/vsd_fleet_ms) project, enhanced with comprehensive documentation and additional features based on real customer needs. The original project was built by VVSD-LTD after studying SAP's fleet management solutions, making it one of the most sophisticated fleet management applications in the ERPNext ecosystem.

**Why This Fork Exists**: Instead of building a new fleet management system from scratch, this fork provides a solid foundation with professional documentation, allowing developers to start with a proven solution and contribute improvements.

## üêõ Known Issues & Easy First Contributions

### **DocType Naming Convention** ‚≠ê **Perfect for New Contributors**

**üéØ The Perfect First Contribution Opportunity!**

Many doctypes are in plural format (e.g., `trips`, `trucks`, `drivers`) due to conflicts with existing ERPNext doctypes during local customization. This is a known issue that provides an excellent first contribution opportunity:

#### **Why This Happened**
There were conflicts with existing local customization app doctypes that were already present on sites. The following doctypes already existed and caused naming conflicts:

**Existing ERPNext Doctypes that Caused Conflicts:**
- `trip` - Already exists in ERPNext core
- `truck` - Already exists in ERPNext core  
- `driver` - Already exists in ERPNext core
- `trailer` - Already exists in ERPNext core
- `route` - Already exists in ERPNext core
- `location` - Already exists in ERPNext core
- `fuel` - Already exists in ERPNext core
- `expense` - Already exists in ERPNext core
- `payment` - Already exists in ERPNext core
- `request` - Already exists in ERPNext core

**Solution Applied:**
The easiest solution was to make the doctypes plural to avoid naming conflicts:
- `trip` ‚Üí `trips`
- `truck` ‚Üí `trucks` 
- `driver` ‚Üí `drivers`
- `trailer` ‚Üí `trailers`
- `route` ‚Üí `routes`
- `location` ‚Üí `locations`
- `fuel` ‚Üí `fuels`
- `expense` ‚Üí `expenses`
- `payment` ‚Üí `payments`
- `request` ‚Üí `requests`

#### **The Issue**
- **Current**: `trips`, `trucks`, `drivers`, `trailers`, etc.
- **Should be**: `trip`, `truck`, `driver`, `trailer`, etc.
- **Impact**: Minor - affects naming convention only
- **Difficulty**: Easy - suitable for new contributors

#### **Files to Modify**
- `vsd_fleet_ms/doctype/trips/` ‚Üí `vsd_fleet_ms/doctype/trip/`
- `vsd_fleet_ms/doctype/trucks/` ‚Üí `vsd_fleet_ms/doctype/truck/`
- `vsd_fleet_ms/doctype/drivers/` ‚Üí `vsd_fleet_ms/doctype/driver/`
- `vsd_fleet_ms/doctype/trailers/` ‚Üí `vsd_fleet_ms/doctype/trailer/`
- And other similar plural doctypes

#### **What You Need to Do**
1. **Rename directories** from plural to singular
2. **Update JSON files** to reflect new names
3. **Update Python imports** and references
4. **Update JavaScript references** if any
5. **Test thoroughly** to ensure nothing breaks

#### **Why This is Perfect for New Contributors**
- ‚úÖ **Clear scope** - well-defined task
- ‚úÖ **Low risk** - naming convention change only
- ‚úÖ **Good learning** - understand Frappe doctype structure
- ‚úÖ **High impact** - improves code consistency
- ‚úÖ **Easy to test** - clear before/after state

### **Other Easy Contribution Areas**
- **Documentation improvements** - Fix typos, add examples, clarify instructions
- **Code comments** - Add docstrings and inline comments
- **UI text** - Improve field labels and descriptions
- **Error messages** - Make them more user-friendly

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 16+
- Git
- Frappe Bench (for ERPNext development)

### **Local Development Environment**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nelsonmpanju/Fleet-Management-System.git
   cd Fleet-Management-System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Install Node.js dependencies (if any)
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Frappe Bench**
   ```bash
   # Install Frappe Bench
   pip install frappe-bench
   
   # Initialize bench
   bench init frappe-bench
   cd frappe-bench
   
   # Create new site
   bench new-site fleet-ms.local
   
   # Install ERPNext
   bench get-app erpnext
   bench --site fleet-ms.local install-app erpnext
   
   # Install VSD Fleet MS
   bench get-app vsd_fleet_ms
   bench --site fleet-ms.local install-app vsd_fleet_ms
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   bench start
   ```

### **Code Style Guidelines**

#### **Python Code**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

```python
def create_vehicle_trip_from_manifest(manifest_name, transporter_type):
    """
    Create a vehicle trip from an existing manifest.
    
    Args:
        manifest_name (str): Name of the source manifest
        transporter_type (str): Type of transporter (In House/Sub-Contractor)
    
    Returns:
        dict: Created trip document data
    """
    # Implementation here
```

#### **JavaScript Code**
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Handle errors gracefully

```javascript
/**
 * Assign cargo to manifest with validation
 * @param {string} cargoId - Cargo identifier
 * @param {string} manifestName - Target manifest name
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Assignment result
 */
async function assignCargoToManifest(cargoId, manifestName) {
    try {
        // Implementation here
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Assignment failed:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```

#### **DocType Development**
- Use descriptive field names
- Include proper validation rules
- Add helpful field descriptions
- Follow ERPNext naming conventions
